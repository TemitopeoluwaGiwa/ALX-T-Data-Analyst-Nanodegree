# Analyzing Twitter's WeRateDogs Tweets Datasets
## by Giwa Temitopeoluwa Hafsat


## Dataset

> In this project, I made good use of three datasets on the popular [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)'s tweets on twitter. These datasets contains various features for about 2354 unique dog tweets. Precisely,the three datasets contain information about each image predictions on each tweet, each tweet in the archive,number of likes,number of retweets/favorite etc. 


## Summary of Findings

> Most of the dogs in the tweets were puppers. I also found out that there is a positive relationship between the number of likes on a dog tweet and the number of retweets on the dog tweet i.e the high people like the tweet,the higher people retweet it simultaneously.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> 
* We have 179 correct out of 220 predictions of an image containing a dog which shows that the predictive model(neural networks) might be able to predict future images with the question - 'Does this image contain a dog?
* There is a very strong correlation of magnitude 0.93 which shows that,the higher the number of likes,the higher the number of retweets
* We have no consistent predictions of dog breeds which may indicate that the neural network or kind of neural network might not be able to predict dog breed from future images
