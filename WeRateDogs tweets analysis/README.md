# Analyzing Twitter's WeRateDogs Tweets Datasets
## by Giwa Temitopeoluwa Hafsat


## Dataset

> In this project, I analyzed three datasets of tweets from the popular Twitter account [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). The datasets contained information about 2354 unique dog tweets, including image predictions, number of likes, and number of retweets.

## Summary of Findings

> Most of the dogs in the tweets were puppies, suggesting that the Twitter account [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is popular among users who are interested in puppies. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the number of likes and retweets on a dog tweet, meaning that tweets with more likes were also more likely to be retweeted. This suggests that tweets featuring puppies are particularly popular with [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) followers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> 
* Accuracy of 179 out of 220 predictions suggests that the predictive model (neural networks) may be able to predict future images with the question "Does this image contain a dog?"
* A strong correlation of magnitude 0.93 indicates that the number of likes and retweets are highly correlated, meaning that tweets with more likes are likely to have more retweets.
* Inconsistency in dog breed predictions suggests that the neural network or kind of neural network may not be able to predict dog breeds from future images.

## Recommendations
* To predict dog breeds more accurately, use more dog pictures or a different neural network design.
* Check if the correlation between likes and retweets is general or specific to [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
* Use the WeRateDogs dataset to learn more about dog ownership and behavior, such as trends in dog names and reasons dogs are featured.
