# Exploring the Impact of Child Mortality, Life Expectancy, and Fertility Rates on Future Global Growth.
## by (Giwa Temitopeoluwa Hafsat)


## Dataset

> The datasets that were used for this project were gotten from the [gapminder website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) where the child mortality,Life Expectancy and Total Fertility are indicator datasets i.e they can tell why there is an increase or decrease in population in this case. These indicator datasets were collected for the range of years of (1800 to 2100).



## Summary of Findings

> After my Exploratory data analysis, I was able deduce that deaths of children under age 5 and expected number of years to be lived have a negative relationship i.e as the deaths of children under age 5 was increasing,the expected number of years to be lived was  decreasing.
I also noticed how there was a rapid decrease in deaths of children under age 5 over the years and a rapid increase in expected number of years to be lived over time. 
There is also a fast decrease in the rate at which women are giving birth to children  over time which might be due to alot of reasons e.g quality education etc.


## Key Insights for Presentation

1. The country with the lowest fertility rate in 2022 is Moldova with an estimated fertility rate of 1.24 children.
2. The year/years that have the least and most deaths of under-5 year olds recorded are 2099 and 2100 with mortality rates of approximately 0.25 deaths and 0.25 deaths respectively.
3. The number of years a citizen of Nigeria is expected to live in 2023 is estimated to be 65.8years
