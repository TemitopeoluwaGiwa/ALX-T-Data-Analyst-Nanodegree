# Exploring the Impact of Child Mortality, Life Expectancy, and Fertility Rates on Future Global Growth.
## by (Giwa Temitopeoluwa Hafsat)


## Dataset

> This project used indicator datasets from the [Gapminder website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)  to explore trends in child mortality, life expectancy, and total fertility rates (TFRs) from 1800 to 2100. These indicators can provide insights into the factors that drive population growth or decline.


## Summary of Findings

>My exploratory data analysis revealed a negative correlation between child mortality and life expectancy, meaning that as child mortality rates decrease, life expectancy rates increase. I also observed a rapid decline in child mortality rates and a rapid increase in life expectancy rates over time. Additionally, I found that total fertility rates (TFRs) have been decreasing over time, which could be due to a number of factors, such as improved access to education and contraception.


## Key Insights for Presentation

1. Moldova has the lowest fertility rate in 2022, with an estimated rate of 1.24 children per woman.
2. Child mortality rates are lowest in 2099-2100, with approximately 0.25 deaths per 1000 live births.
3. Nigerians are expected to live an average of 65.8 years in 2023.
