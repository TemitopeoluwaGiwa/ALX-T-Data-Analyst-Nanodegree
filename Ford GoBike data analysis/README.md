## by (Giwa Temitopeoluwa Hafsat)


## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike dataset encompasses a wealth of information on the Bay Area's bike share and rental system. Comprising 183,412 bike ride records, it provides comprehensive insights into rides conducted across the greater San Francisco Bay area during the month of February in 2019. The dataset includes critical features such as ride duration, user type, station names, and more, making it a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of bike sharing and transportation trends in the region during that specific time frame.



## Summary of Findings

> The bike sharing system boasts both advantages and disadvantages, but one notable benefit is its role in enhancing transit convenience and flexibility. Although bike usage primarily occurs on weekdays, particularly Thursdays, in terms of trip duration, this pattern encourages users to engage in more extended journeys during weekends while opting for shorter ones on weekdays. Weekend trips are typically sporadic, whereas weekday ones tend to be repetitive. This dynamic contributes to the system's appeal to subscribers, making them stand out as they leverage these features to their advantage.
